This is version 0.9 of Serialysis, a library to parse serialized Java objects.
See http://weblogs.java.net/blog/emcmanus/archive/2007/06/disassembling_s.html
for an introduction.

These files are structured as a NetBeans project, but you do not need
NetBeans to build.  You just need a recent version of Apache Ant (at
least 1.6).  "ant jar" will rebuild serialysis.jar and "ant javadoc"
will rebuild the Javadoc output.  You will probably need to change or
remove the -J options in the javadoc.additionalparam property in
nbproject/project.properties, which are there to allow Javadoc to
work behind a firewall.

The license is a GNU license modified in a similar way to the GNU
Classpath project and the OpenJDK project.  If you use the code
unmodified, you shouldn't need to worry about the license.  If you
modify it and distribute your modifications, then you must make the
source of those modifications available.  (One way to do this is to
send the modifications to me, a@b.c where a=eamonn, b=mcmanus, c=net;
then I can incorporate the modifications into the main version.)  The
license does NOT require you to distribute the source of your own
programs just because they use Serialysis.

If there's demand, I'll make this a project on java.net.
